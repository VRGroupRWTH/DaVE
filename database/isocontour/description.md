### Description ###
The extraction of isocontours is a fundamental visualization technique used in many research areas for the exploration of primarily three-dimensional scalar datasets.
In this example, the extraction of an isocontour is demonstrated for a medical use case in which the x-ray scan of a paitents foot needs to be visualized.
The dataset used in this example contains a dimensional scalar field that captures the density of the tissues and bones within the foot of the patient [2](#reference_dataset).
The extraction of isocontours is particularly interesting in this use case as it allows for an isolated view on specific structures within the foot.
By selecting an appropriate threshold for the extraction, it is for example possible to visualize only the bones in the foot, which enables the diagnosis of potential fractures.

### Instructions ###
The archive that can be downloaded after the configuration of the example contains the shell script `isocontour_script.sh` that creates an isocontour for the provided dataset.
The script can be started by ruinning the following command in the terminal
```
./isocontour_script.sh
```
In some cases it is neccessary to first mark the script as executible which can be done by running the following line in the terminal
```
chmod +x isocontour_script.sh
```
After a successful execution of the script, the image `isocontour.png` containing the final visualization of the provided dataset is placed in the folder `output`.

## 3. Provision of the Website and Creation of Log Files ##

### a) Subject Matter and Purpose of Processing ###
This website provides information and resources for the visualization of scientific data. Each time you access the website, a technical exchange of information between your device (e.g., computer, tablet, mobile phone) and the server is required to deliver the site. In this context, data about the request is temporarily processed and stored in log files. Specifically, the following log data is collected:

* Date and time of access
* User’s IP address
* Request details and destination address (requested URL)
* Name of the file accessed
* Amount of data transferred
* Notification of whether the request was successful (status)
* Browser type and version
* User’s operating system
* User’s internet service provider
* The website from which the user’s system accessed the RWTH Aachen University website (referrer)
* Information about the pages and files accessed

Log data is processed to ensure the proper operation of the website (e.g., detecting, limiting, and remedying faults or errors). In addition, log data is processed for technical security purposes, in particular to protect against and defend against cyberattacks. This processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and Article 32(1) GDPR.

### b) Legal Basis for Processing ###
The temporary processing necessary for technical delivery and the creation of log files is based on Article 6(1)(e) and (3) GDPR in conjunction with Section 3(1) of the Data Protection Act of North Rhine-Westphalia (Datenschutzgesetz Nordrhein-Westfalen, DSG NRW) and Section 3(1) of the Higher Education Act of North Rhine-Westphalia (Hochschulgesetz Nordrhein-Westfalen, HG NRW).

### c) Data Deletion and Storage Period ###
Data is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected – generally after no more than seven days. Storage beyond this period may occur; in such cases, users’ IP addresses are deleted or anonymized so they can no longer be attributed to a specific client.

## 4. Use of Cookies ##
We do not use cookies or any tracking technologies.

## 5. Contact ##

### a) Subject Matter and Purpose of Processing ###
You can contact the Visualization Research Group at RWTH Aachen University by email or post. Your personal data is processed exclusively to handle your request (e.g., responding to your question or facilitating the exercise of data subject rights). Data is stored for further correspondence within the scope of the Visualization Research Group’s activities. If you contact us by email, we store the data you choose to provide so we can respond.

### b) Legal Basis for Processing ###
This processing is carried out to fulfill the university’s tasks pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) and (3) GDPR in conjunction with Section 3(1) DSG NRW and Section 3(1) HG NRW.

### c) Data Deletion and Storage Period ###
We delete personal data received by email or collected via post as soon as storage is no longer necessary for your stated purpose or for related administrative processes, subject to applicable retention obligations. The retention period for an administrative process is ten years after the last entry has been processed. Data related to the exercise of data subject rights is retained for three years.

## 6. YouTube ##
The RWTH website uses plugins from YouTube, a service operated by Google. The operator is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you visit a page that includes a YouTube plugin, a connection to YouTube’s servers is established, informing YouTube which of our pages you visited. If you are logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube can associate your browsing behavior with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account. For details on how YouTube processes personal data, please refer to YouTube’s privacy policy: [https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy)

## 7. Rights of the Data Subject ##
If your personal data is processed, you have the following rights vis-à-vis the controller: Under Articles 15 et seq. GDPR, and subject to the conditions defined therein, you have the right to:

* Access your personal data (Art. 15),
* Rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data (Art. 16),
* Erasure (“right to be forgotten,” Art. 17),
* Restriction of processing (Art. 18),
* Data portability (receive your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and transmit those data; Art. 20), and
* Object to processing (Art. 21).

Under Article 77 GDPR, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority ([https://www.ldi.nrw.de/kontakt](https://www.ldi.nrw.de/kontakt)) if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR. If processing is based on your consent (see Art. 6(1)(a) or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR), you may withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal; the withdrawal takes effect only for the future.

## What is DaVE? ##
Welcome to DaVE - the Database of Visualization Examples.
The goal of DaVE is simple: empower users, especially working with High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure, with easy access to advanced and state-of-the-art visualization techniques.
We understand that many face a lack of time or resources to explore and integrate new techniques.
However, most also know about the benefits and seek to enhance their simulations with effective visualizations to explore, analyze, or present their data.

DaVE serves as a centralized repository where users can find and discover visualization examples tailored to their specific needs through a simple search.
Our database is designed to be user-friendly, offering seamless integration into existing workflows using adaptable containers.
Whether you're exploring cutting-edge visualizations for data or seeking practical solutions to enhance your simulations, DaVE seeks to find helpful resources for you.

And the best part: DaVE is designed to keep growing!
Everybody can join our mission and [add more examples and resources](/guide#Extending_DaVE).

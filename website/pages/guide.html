                        <p>
                            The database of DaVE contains selection of commonly used vizualization techniuqes and provides documentation and addtional resources for them.
                            To find a visualization, ether a search term can be used and or tags can be used to further narrow down the selection.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="tags" outline_label="Tags" outline_indent="0">
                        <h3>Tags</h3>
                        <p>
                            Searching visualization techniques with a search query alone would be far too general, as there are often many techniques that would match the query but have totally different properties.
                            To make the search function of DaVE more specific, every technique in the database owns a set of tags that are used to further describe the properties of a visualization technique.
                        </p>
                        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

                        <p>
                            For example, a technique with the tag <span class="mx-1 badge text-primary-emphasis bg-primary-subtle border-primary-subtle px-2 py-1">Scalar</span> would be suitable for datasets consisting of real-valued samples, e.g. a dataset describing the temperature within a room.
                            The tags that are used throughout the database are divided into two groups.
                            Blue tags are used to identify technical properties such as the domain for which a visualization can be used or whether the technique can be used for time-dependent datasets.
                            On the other hand, green tags are used to identify the scientific domain for which a technique is particularly suitable.

                        <h3>Visualizations</h3>
                        <p>
                            Besides of giving an overview over different vizualization techniuqes and providing addtional information, the goal of DaVE is also to make every technique accessible to users.
                            However, this can be quite challanging as different uesers may use different software environments meaning that the environment in which a vizualization technique should be executed is not always known.
                            DaVE therefore havily relies on the use of containers with which the software for the viszualization technique can be encapsulated.
                            The container as well as additonal resources of a vizualization technique can be downloaded separately.
                            However, there is also the option to create a template that combines al resources of a techniuqe and that is condifured for a specific use case.

                        <h3>Templates</h3>
                        <p>
                            A template combines all neccessary resources for a visualization techniuqe that are needed to render an image for a given dataset.
                            If required the template also contains a preview dataset with which the technique can be tested.
                            The shell script that is always included in the template zip file of the template controlls and automates the execution of the vizualization technique.
                            When running the script, it loads a container, depending on the configuration of the template ether a docker container or a sigulairty container.

                            The container that is currently used for most of the visualization techniuqes, contains ParaView which is a software commonly used for sientify visualizations and data exploration.
                            When loading the container, ParaView is instructed to load a trace file which describes the visualization techniuqe it self and all the steps that ParaView has to take to apply the visualization on the given dataset.
                            ParaView then loads the Dataset and renders it according to the Trace File.
                            The resulting image is then stored in the same directory in which the script file is located.
                            Currently the script as well as the containers only run under linux based operating systems.

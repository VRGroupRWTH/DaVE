                        <p>
                            Searching visualization techniques with a search query alone would be far too general, as there are often many techniques that would match the query but have totally different properties.
                            To make the search function of DaVE more specific, every technique in the database owns a set of tags that are used to further describe the properties of a visualization technique.
                            For example, a technique with the tag <span class="mx-1 badge text-primary-emphasis bg-primary-subtle border-primary-subtle px-2 py-1">Scalar</span> would be suitable for datasets consisting of real-valued samples, e.g. a dataset describing the temperature within a room.
                            The tags that are used throughout the database are divided into two groups.
                            Blue tags are used to identify technical properties such as the domain for which a visualization can be used or whether the technique can be used for time-dependent datasets.
                            On the other hand, green tags are used to identify the scientific domain for which a technique is particularly suitable.
